Now
what
if
our
whole
childhood
was
like
that
last
seconds?
How
hard
it
would
be
for
a
child
to
feel
calm.
To
feel
safe.
To
learn
to
trust
anyone.
And 
the 
lifelong
impact
that
would 
have. 
That 
makes 
me 
feel 
sad.  
only 
reacted 
the 
way 
he 
did 
and 
recovered 
so 
quickly 
Think
